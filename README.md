# GUI-for-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This repository contains a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) for handwritten digit recognition using a neural network. The GUI is built with Tkinter for the interface, and the neural network model is implemented using the Keras library.

## Features
<br>Drawing Canvas: Users can draw digits on a canvas using the left mouse button.
<br>Training the Model: Train the neural network model using the MNIST dataset by specifying the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate.
<br>Prediction: After drawing a digit, users can predict the digit using the trained model.
<br>Clear Canvas: Clear the drawing canvas to start fresh.
